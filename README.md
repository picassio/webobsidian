# WebObsidian

**A self-hosted, Obsidian-compatible web app for your Markdown "second brain".**

Point it at a folder of Markdown files and edit your notes from any browser — with a
CodeMirror editor, live preview, wikilinks, an interactive graph, full-text search,
Git backup/version history (incl. Git LFS), an API for AI agents, and community-plugin support.

## What is this?

WebObsidian is a web application that gives you an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-like
experience over **real folders of Markdown files** living on your server. Each registered vault is
100% compatible with an existing Obsidian vault (including the `.obsidian/` folder) — you
can edit the same files from the Obsidian desktop app and from the web, side by side.

It is **single-user** and self-hosted: one master password protects the whole app, all
configuration lives in a plain `data/settings.json` (no database engine), and the entire
stack runs from a single `docker compose up`.

> **Why?** To access and edit your knowledge base from any browser, on any device, while
> keeping full ownership of your files — and to let AI agents read/write your vault through
> a safe, scoped REST API.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ **Multiple isolated vaults** — register and switch between several vaults in one server process; each has
  independent sync history/devices, search, Git backup, shares, plugins and workspace state. See
  [docs/MULTI_VAULT.md](docs/MULTI_VAULT.md).
- 📝 **Editor & rendering** — CodeMirror 6 with live / source / reading views; wikilinks
  `[[note]]`, embeds `![[file]]`, tags `#tag`, callouts, task lists, KaTeX math and
  Mermaid diagrams.
- 🕸️ **Graph view** — force-directed graph built from your wikilinks, with fly-to node
  search and highlighting.
- 🔗 **Backlinks & outline** — right sidebar tab strip: Backlinks (linked **and** unlinked
  mentions), Outgoing links (resolved/unresolved), Tags and Outline.
- 🔍 **QMD search** — fast full-text + fielded search (`tag:`, `path:`, `title:`), fuzzy +
  prefix matching, incremental indexing, persisted to disk for fast startup.
- 🔄 **Git backup & version history** — commit/push authoritative Central Sync snapshots with **Git LFS**
  for large attachments; remote changes enter through explicit previewed imports. Upgraded installations may
  retain warned legacy bidirectional Git only until Central Sync is enabled.
- 🔐 **Login gate** — a single master password (scrypt-hashed) protects everything; JWT in
  an httpOnly cookie.
- 🌐 **Public sharing** — turn any note into a read-only, server-rendered (SEO-friendly)
  public page at `/share/<token>`, optionally password-protected.
- 🤖 **Agent API** — scoped API keys (`read` / `write` / `search`) let AI agents work with
  the vault over REST at `/api/v1`. See [docs/AGENT_API.md](docs/AGENT_API.md).
- 🧩 **Community plugins** — install Obsidian plugins from GitHub; loaded against an
  Obsidian-API compatibility shim (subset support).
- 📱 **Responsive / mobile** — drawer sidebars, edge-swipe, an on-keyboard formatting
  toolbar, and touch-friendly targets, à la Obsidian Mobile.
- 🗃️ **Pure-JSON config** — everything lives in `data/settings.json`. No database.
- 🐳 **Docker** — one command to run the whole stack.

## 🚀 Quick start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xnohat/webobsidian.git
cd webobsidian
cp .env.example .env          # edit VAULT_HOST_PATH, set WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d --build
# open http://localhost:8787
```

Out of the box it serves the bundled `./sample-vault`, so the stack boots immediately. All
deployment settings live in **`.env`** (git-ignored) — you never edit the tracked
`docker-compose.yml`, so a `git pull` / redeploy keeps your config and vault mapping intact.

> 🔑 **Default password is `123456`.** Log in right away, then change it in
> **Settings → Account**. To seed a different password on first run, set
> `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` in `.env`. Forgot it? Set `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` (plaintext) or
> `auth.passwordHash` (scrypt) as a recovery override.

### Point it at your own vault

```bash
# .env
VAULT_HOST_PATH=/abs/path/to/your/ObsidianVault   # must exist; bind-mounted to /vault
DATA_HOST_PATH=/abs/path/to/webobsidian-data      # optional bind; otherwise a managed volume
WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD=use-a-strong-password
HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0                                  # 127.0.0.1 to expose only to localhost
HTTP_PORT=8787
```

Then `docker compose up -d --build`. Your vault can be a plain folder or a `git clone`
(Git LFS is supported for attachments).

For multiple vaults, mount their common parent and register each child path in **Settings → Vault & Files**:

```bash
# .env
VAULTS_HOST_PATH=/abs/path/to/ObsidianVaults   # mounted at /vaults
```

Register `/vaults/Personal`, `/vaults/Work`, etc. Roots must be distinct and non-overlapping. See
[Multiple vaults](docs/MULTI_VAULT.md).

### Behind a reverse proxy (TLS)

Set `HTTP_BIND=127.0.0.1` so the app is only reachable from the host, then terminate TLS
with nginx / Caddy / Traefik in front of `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

### Large vaults & file watching

A fresh VPS ships a low `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` (often 8192), which a big vault
exceeds. WebObsidian auto-detects this and falls back to **polling** (works anywhere,
higher CPU). For lower CPU, raise the kernel limit and keep native watching:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
echo 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

The search index (QMD) and link graph are kept in memory, so memory use scales with the
number of notes. The Docker image sets `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` (4 GB);
raise it to `8192` for very large vaults (e.g. 6k+ notes / multi-GB).

## 💻 Local development

Requires **Node ≥ 20** and `git` (+ `git-lfs` if you use LFS).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # server on :8787 + web dev server on :5173 (proxied)
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Production build (the server serves the built SPA):

```bash
npm run build
VAULT_PATH=./sample-vault npm start
# open http://localhost:8787
```

Useful scripts:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Run server + web together in watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Build the web SPA, then compile the server |
| `npm start` | Run the production server (serves built web) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check all workspaces |
| `npm test` | Run core, server, browser, and headless test suites |
| `npm run lint:docs` | Validate relative Markdown targets and anchors |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Docker env (`.env`, consumed by `docker-compose.yml`)

| Var | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `VAULT_HOST_PATH` | `./sample-vault` | Host path bind-mounted to `/vault` |
| `VAULTS_HOST_PATH` | `./sample-vaults` | Optional host parent bind-mounted to `/vaults` for additional vaults |
| `DATA_HOST_PATH` | managed `webobsidian-data` volume | Optional host directory bind-mounted to `/data` for settings and all vault metadata |
| `HTTP_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | Host interface to publish on (`127.0.0.1` = local only) |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8787` | Host port mapped to container `8787` |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` | – | Seed/override the master password |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_WATCH` | `auto` | `auto` (native + polling fallback) or `polling` |

### App-level env (read by the server; Docker sets these inside the container)

| Var | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8787` | HTTP port |
| `VAULT_PATH` | `./sample-vault` | Path to the notes vault |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where `settings.json` + search index live |
| `ALLOWED_ROOTS` | – | Comma-separated roots the vault picker may browse |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_PASSWORD` | – | Seed/override the master password |
| `WEBOBSIDIAN_WATCH` | `auto` | File-watch mode: `auto` or `polling` |
| `NODE_OPTIONS` | `--max-old-space-size=4096` | Node heap size — raise for large vaults |

Everything else — git remote/token, API keys, plugins, theme — is configured in the
**Settings** UI and stored in `data/settings.json`.

## 🤖 Agent API

Scoped REST API for AI agents at `/api/v1`. Create an API key in **Settings → API Keys**,
then pass it as a header. Full reference: **[docs/AGENT_API.md](docs/AGENT_API.md)**.

### 🧩 Drop-in agent skill (no clone needed)

Want your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor…) to work with your vault
directly? **Copy the block below and paste it to your agent.** It downloads the skill from
GitHub, asks for your URL + API key once, saves them to `~/.webobsidian/credentials.json`,
and can then read/write/search your notes on request.

> First create an API key in the app at **Settings → API Keys** (scopes `read`/`write`/`search`).

```text
SYSTEM / TASK — Install the "webobsidian" agent skill from GitHub, then set up credentials.
Do every step in order; do not skip the credential step.

STEP 1 — Download the skill into your runtime's skills directory
  (Claude Code: ~/.claude/skills · Codex: ~/.codex/skills · OpenCode: ~/.opencode/skills):
      SKILLS_DIR=~/.claude/skills        # change for your runtime
      mkdir -p "$SKILLS_DIR/webobsidian"
      curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xnohat/webobsidian/main/docs/agent-skill/webobsidian/SKILL.md \
        -o "$SKILLS_DIR/webobsidian/SKILL.md"

STEP 2 — Set up credentials (ASK ME; never echo the key back). Ask me for my WebObsidian
  base URL (e.g. https://notes.example.com) and my API key (looks like wok_...), then:
      mkdir -p ~/.webobsidian && chmod 700 ~/.webobsidian
      printf '{ "baseUrl": "%s", "apiKey": "%s" }\n' "<BASE_URL>" "<API_KEY>" > ~/.webobsidian/credentials.json
      chmod 600 ~/.webobsidian/credentials.json

STEP 3 — Verify (do NOT print the key) and confirm ready:
      BASE=$(python3 -c 'import json,os;print(json.load(open(os.path.expanduser("~/.webobsidian/credentials.json")))["baseUrl"].rstrip("/"))')
      KEY=$(python3 -c 'import json,os;print(json.load(open(os.path.expanduser("~/.webobsidian/credentials.json")))["apiKey"])')
      curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/health"
      curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "$BASE/api/v1/tags" | head
  From now on, when I ask you to work with my WebObsidian / Obsidian vault, use the webobsidian skill.
```

## 🔒 Security notes

- Master password is scrypt-hashed; the JWT secret is auto-generated.
- API keys are hashed at rest and scoped (`read` / `write` / `search`) with per-key rate
  limiting and audit logging.
- All file paths are guarded against traversal, case-fold collision, and symlink ancestors; the vault picker is
  confined to `ALLOWED_ROOTS`. Browser device credentials are httpOnly and never enter JavaScript/IndexedDB.
- Secrets (git token / API keys) live in `data/settings.json` on the server — mount `/data`
  as a private volume and keep it off version control. **Change the default password.**

---

## 🗺️ Compatibility & scope

- ✅ Works directly on an existing Obsidian vault, including `.obsidian/` config.
- ⚠️ **Single-user (v1)** — no real-time multi-user collaborative editing yet.
- 🧪 The authoritative revisioned Central Sync server and revision-safe browser client are implemented and
  undergoing stable-release validation. Git is backup/version history only while Central Sync is enabled.
- 🧩 The mobile-compatible native plugin source is public at
  [picassio/central-vault-sync](https://github.com/picassio/central-vault-sync); the downloadable
  [0.1.14 Community review release](https://github.com/picassio/central-vault-sync/releases/tag/0.1.14) is not yet accepted
  in Community Plugins. [`@picassio/sync-core@0.1.3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picassio/sync-core/v/0.1.3)
  and [`web-vault-sync@0.1.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vault-sync/v/0.1.0) are public and registry-origin
  verified with Linux systemd and a healthy non-root sidecar. Registry container images remain intentionally unpublished.
  See the [roadmap](docs/SYNC_ROADMAP.md), [compatibility matrix](docs/sync/COMPATIBILITY.md),
  and [operations runbook](docs/sync/OPERATIONS.md).
- ⚠️ Community-plugin support is a **subset** of the Obsidian API; plugins relying on
  Electron/Node internals may not work.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few house rules from [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md):

1. **Follow [PRD.md](PRD.md).** It is the source of truth for design. Changing scope means
   updating the PRD first (with a changelog bump), then the code.
2. **Keep [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) in sync** — flip checkboxes and
   add a progress-log line as you work.
3. TypeScript everywhere; avoid `any`. Runtime config is JSON only (no DB engine).
4. Never log secrets/tokens; hash before storing; guard against path traversal.

Run `npm run typecheck` before opening a PR.
